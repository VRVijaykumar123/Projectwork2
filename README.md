## Title of the Project
REAL-TIME ADAPATIVE DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR CYBERBULLYING DETECTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Cyberbullying, a pervasive issue in modern society, involves the use of digital communication technologies to harass, threaten, or embarrass others.
Social media platforms, while connecting people globally, have also become breeding grounds for cyberbullying activities.
Traditional methods of detecting cyberbullying often fall short due to the evolving nature of online language and the sheer volume of content generated.
This project aims to leverage deep learning algorithms to develop a robust and effective system for detecting cyberbullying incidents on social media platforms

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The system detects cyberbullying by highlighting flagged comments in real-time. Users can report false positives and negatives, helping improve the detection model. It'sevaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and performance is continuously monitored post-deployment for ongoing improvements
This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
